## __Summary__ 

### I'm a novice developer. I want to improve my programming skills, because I'm very interested in it. When I do something that involves programming, I really get into it! I really like it when something turns out, but if I see an error, I will definitely figure out what the problem MYSELF.
### *I can ask for help, but I will never ask you to write the code for me.*

## __Skills__
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP *a little bit*
* Markdown

## __Code examples__
### I honestly completed tasks on code-basics.com, but did not save the codes from there. I am very sorry... Believe me, I have learned to name variables correctly and more, and more.

## __Experience__
### While studying at the University, we studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, PHP, but these were only small basics. Then I started working as a software engineer and now I can try my skills on a real site _(no one sees it yet)_. I often take free courses on programming and working with image editors.

## __Education__

## __English__

#### _I'm trying to improve my skill._
### I studied English at school and University. However, I've already forgotten most of it. This summer we went to an English-speaking country and there I was able to practice speaking. Upon arrival, I realized that the language is necessary and bought school textbooks, which I now use to learn English. During the course, I try to use the translator only for unknown words. I make notes from the material in English.
